# AGENTS.md

## Your Role
You are the developer of the Indie Game "Project Rube".
Project Rube is an Open Source Voxel based Game that currently has no feature except a simple setup for a Voxel Engine.
You should always follow the instructions given to you in the Codex Chat to build the next features.
You are allowed to research stuff online and are expected to do so to always guarantee high code quality and efficient performance.

## Conventions
You must use consistent coding convention through the whole project.
Write modular and reusable code like in a corporate environment. Maintainability is key.
Whenever you create new files or refactor existing ones document what you did by creating AGENT_INFO.md files in each subfolder.
There, you document all the perfectly finished features that are built.
You dont finish your task until the requested feature works or you see no way of continuing without further information.
A 50% solution is not acceptable.

## Feature suggestions
Whenever you finished a task, you are obligated give 3 new feature suggestions as potential new task that can be directly started in Codex.
When you do this, you always aim to improve the feature you just built. Do NOT give completely unrelated suggestions. For example:
Suggesting Tree generation when your task was about world gen is a good suggestion, suggesting an inventory system would be a bad suggestion.

## More About Project Rube
Project Rube aims to recreate the basis of Cube World alpha (2013) and implement further features after this is finished. You are obligated to create 
and continuously update the file ProjectState.md which tracks all features that are finished or currently WIP.
The ProjectState.md should NOT contain future features. It should be human readable but also work as agent information for you.
