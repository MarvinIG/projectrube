# Project State

## Finished
- Basic voxel world rendering with free camera controls.
- Title screen with adjustable view width, Start Game and Exit buttons.
- Perlin noise terrain generation on game start with corrected frequency for varied height.
- World generation uses 32×32×32 chunks with a configurable view width radius and a maximum height of 128 blocks, plus stacked 2D noise and 3D noise caves.
- Chunks stream infinitely as the player moves, meshed with a greedy algorithm and culled via camera frustum with distance-based LOD.

## WIP
- None
