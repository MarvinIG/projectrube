# AGENT_INFO

- Implemented a title screen with adjustable view width and exit/start buttons using the Bevy 0.16 UI system.
- Added Perlin noise terrain generation via `fastnoise-lite` when starting the game.
- Introduced game states for menu and playing, with camera controls active only during gameplay.
- Added a dedicated MenuCamera and cleanup logic for spawning and despawning the menu UI camera.
- Corrected Perlin noise frequency so terrain heights vary properly.
- Refactored gameplay, menu, player controls, and world resources into separate modules to slim down `main.rs`.
- Stacked multiple 2D Perlin noise layers for wide-spread terrain variation.
- Reintroduced 3D Perlin noise to carve sparse caves and cliffs while adding hills
- Switched to chunk-based world generation using 32×32×32 chunks with a configurable view width radius (default 4) and a maximum height of 256 blocks.
- Added multithreaded infinite chunk streaming with greedy meshing, frustum culling, and distance-based LOD.
- Fixed chunk gap bug by generating neighbor border voxels and upgrading nearby chunks to full resolution.
- Colored voxels: top blocks render green, subsoil brown, and underground stone gray.
- Tuned noise amplitudes for varied hills and corrected mesh offset so all block faces render.
- Added menu controls for five stacked terrain noise layers, editable and persisted to `settings.json` with the `L` key.
- Pressing `P` during gameplay returns to the title screen and cleans up the world and player entities.
- Chunk generation now spans the vertical axis, spawning up to eight stacked chunk layers for a full 3D grid.
- Reduced-detail chunk rendering now begins beyond eight chunks from the player and samples the top surface block so distant terrain colors stay accurate.
- Cliffs and overhangs form using extra ridged noise, with rarer stone boulders and noise-driven forests of taller wood-and-leaf trees.
 - Boulder placement now mirrors tree generation with separate density and scatter noise and irregular 3D Perlin shapes.
 - Tree trunks randomly span 1×1 to 3×3 blocks with proportionally scaled height and canopy radius, skipping spawn when trunks would collide.
